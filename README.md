# TIPseqHunter
> Dockerfile for TIPseqHunter pipeline

## Getting Started

### Motivation

Here we present the [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/) version of TIPseqHunter pipeline.Â This approach has the ability to encapsulate all java dependencies, read aligners, genome indexes and biological annotation files needed by both steps of the pipeline: [`TIPseqHunterPipelinejar.sh`](https://github.com/galantelab/tipseq_hunter/blob/master/bin/TIPseqHunterPipelineJar.sh) and [`TipseqHunterPipelineJarSomatic.sh`], once manipulating all these dependencies ends up being a little tricky depending on user expertise. 

### Prerequisities

In order to run this container you'll need docker installed.

* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/started)
* [OS X](https://docs.docker.com/mac/started/)
* [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/)

### Acquiring TIPseqHunter Image

#### Manual Installation

Clone this repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/galantelab/tipseq_hunter.git`

> TIPseqHunter needs biological annotation files that occupy a few gigabytes. In order to deal with these files, we created a gzipped tarball which is currently hosted in AWS. So, to successfully build the docker image, it is required to define the variable `tarball_url`, which may point to the tarball URL, to the **docker build** command.

Inside the tipseq_hunter folder, build the image:

`$ docker build --build-arg tarball_url=https://bioinfohsl-webusers.s3.amazonaws.com/tmiller/tipseq_hunter_data.tar.gz -t tipseqhunter .`

Another and better option is using the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/galantelab/tipseq_hunter/blob/master/Makefile) inside tipseq_hunter folder:

`$ make build`

#### Pulling Image

Pull **tipseqhunter** image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com) registry:

`$ docker pull galantelab/tipseqhunter`

Or using Makefile:

`$ make pull`

> Pay attention! You will need to use `sudo` in the commands if you are not member of the docker group

### Usage

Once installed the docker image, the user may apply the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/galantelab/tipseq_hunter/blob/master/Makefile), in order to automate the process of creating the container and running the pipeline, as well as using the ordinary **docker run** command.

#### Examples with docker run

By default the **TIPseqHunterPipelinejar/TipseqHunterPipelineJarSomatic** runs in a container-private folder. You need to change this using flags, like user (-u), current directory, and volumes (-w and -v). It is important to mount the fastq directory and output directory, that way **docker** can find the required files:

```
$ docker run \
	--rm \
	-u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
	-v path_to_fastq_folder:path_to_fastq_folder \
	-v path_to_output_folder:path_to_output_folder \
	-w path_to_output_folder \
	tipseqhunter \
		TIPseqHunterPipelineJar.sh path_to_fastq_folder path_to_output_folder fastq_r1 key_r1 key_r2 number_of_reads
```

That command sets the user UID:GID, mounts the *input/ouput* directories, sets the current working directory as the *output* folder and, finally, runs **TIPseqHunterPipelinejar.sh** script. In the end, the container is automatically removed.

The **TIPseqHunterPipelinejar/TIPseqHunterPipelineJarSomatic** runs based on some cutoffs. There is a default value to each one, but you might change it through environment variables. The best way to do it is by a configuration file to the **docker run** command. You can find an example in [`config.env`](https://github.com/galantelab/tipseq_hunter/blob/master/config.env) file, which is already set to the default values. To use it with **docker run**:

```
$ docker run \
	--rm \
	--env-file=config.env \
	-u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
	-v path_to_fastq_folder:path_to_fastq_folder \
	-v path_to_output_folder:path_to_output_folder \
	-w path_to_output_folder \
	tipseqhunter \
		TIPseqHunterPipelineJar.sh path_to_fastq_folder path_to_output_folder fastq_r1 key_r1 key_r2 number_of_reads
```

#### Examples with Makefile

The `Makefile` can be used to `build`, `pull` and `run` the **TIPseqHunter** scripts inside **docker**:

```
$ make

help                           This help
build                          Build the image
build-nc                       Build the image without caching
pull                           Pull the latest tagged image from the dockerhub registry
remove                         Remove the lattest tagged image
run                            Run TIPseqHunter pipeline completely
run-pipeline                   Run TIPseqHunterPipelineJar.sh
run-pipeline-somatic           Run TIPseqHunterPipelineJarSomatic.sh
up                             Pull and run TIPseqHunter pipeline completely
stop                           Stop and remove a running container
version                        Output the current version

```

When running the pipeline, the `Makefile` automatically searches for a file named `config.env` in the current directory, so
if it exists, you can just call:

`$ make run`

Or use another file with a different name:

`$ make run CONFIG=another_config.txt`

The arguments to **TIPseqHunterPipelinejar/TIPseqHunterPipelineJarSomatic** can be passed into the `config.env` or through the command line:

```
$ make run \
	CONFIG=another_config.txt \
	INPUT_DIR=fastq_folder \
	OUTPUT_DIR=ouput_folder \
	FASTQ_R1=example_R1.fa \
	KEY_R1=R1 \
	KEY_R2=R2 \
	READ_NUM=123456
```

That is it! :smile:
